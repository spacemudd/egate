Cloud online double ways access controller[Plus B version]2018-06-19The working principle      After swiping card(password, identification card,QR code, vein,Finger,Face,RFID,Modbus),on the entrance access controller , real-time transmission to the cloud server, the server process the received data, make a response to the controller, the controller according to the response to make corresponding responses, such as open the door. At the same time can speech and LCD screen display.     Required equipment keeps the network communication with the server, and has TCP\Http protocol for options.
Features* Support two WG card reader interface, support WG2\WG34\and so on agreements, can be configured through the web.* 2 groups 485 interface, two groups button switch input, two groups alarm input, Two relays control output, a relay alarm.* Can connect 2 group temperature and humidity sensors, collect the temperature and humidity, and set the alarm range.* Support two 232 input directly, QR code\ID card collection\vein of fingerprints\ finger\RFID\Face.* 485 support voice module, real-time live broad cast synthetic speech, such as ‘welcome, manager li!’ And controlled by the server software.* Support LCD screen display, realize the screen display on site.* Support TCP/IP UDP Http protocols.* Http protocol supports domain name and IP address server, support custom URL path, is suitable for the cloud application development.* Support 485 communication transmissions, 485 equipment can realize its own communications control.* Support the second generation ID card collection device, can collect ID card information, including photos.* Support receiving large data (not greater than2048 bytes) transmission, such as vein of fingerprints collection, or finger model, sent to the computer to have the comparison.* Support AES128 encryption, custom secret key, the data more secure.* Provide the SDK development kit, as well as the demo code.

Cloud online access controller application scenario[1] Unattended self-service facilities access control management, such as ATM twenty-four hours a day. [2] The factories and venues that cover a wide range of areas and the places that not easy to connect the LAN cabling, such as every gate that far a few miles away chemical plant, base station, weather stations, environmental monitoring station, electric power transformer station, chains, campus, theme parks, etc.[3] Temporary public places, such as the exhibition hall entrance that only open for several days.[4] Unattended public areas, such as park, exhibition hall, etc. [5] Scattered ticket charge places, such as theme parks, amusement places. Such as "window of the world". [6] Public entrance with a multitude of company and factory, can develop the management system that can login by several companies[7] Village entrance, can set visitors self-service access points, can use their phones to scan the QR code on the doorway, to owner (management center) to apply for permission password.to enter  [8] All the above scenario, all can send QR code information to guests and the guests can use the QR code as enter credentials.[9] All the above scenario, can be self-developed server system, realize ticketing system that all sorts of using id and QR code information, according to the received id and QR code to have the identification, in identification to use a variety of business logic to have the operation, so as to realize all kinds of business requirements.[10]All of the projects that need access control, such as a geek, rapid implementation of projects, etc.
