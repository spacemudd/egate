## Field Definitions

- **User ID**: The employee's ID number assigned in the device
- **Date/Time**: When the punch occurred (device local time)
- **Status**: 255 = Normal punch
- **Verify Method**: 
  - 1 = Fingerprint
  - 3 = Password/PIN
  - 4 = Card/Badge
  - 15 = Face recognition

---

## Important Notes

### ‚ö†Ô∏è User Names Not Available

The device currently **does NOT send user names** to the server - only User IDs. To get employee names, you need to:

1. **Access the ZKTeco device web interface** (if supported by your model)
2. **Use ZKTeco's official software** (ZKTime or ZKAccess)
3. **Manually map User IDs to employee names** in your system

### ‚úÖ What's Working

- Device is online and communicating (IP: 91.73.75.13)
- Real-time attendance data is being sent automatically
- Data includes: User ID, Timestamp, Verification method
- All timestamps are in device local time

### ‚ùå What's NOT Working

- `GET USERINFO` command: Device receives it but doesn't respond with user data
- `DATA QUERY ATTLOG` command: Device receives it but doesn't respond with historical data
- The device's firmware may not support these advanced iClock protocol commands

### üìä Data Collection Method

Currently, the server collects attendance data through:
- **Real-time push**: Device automatically uploads each punch immediately after it occurs
- Data is logged to: `/home/forge/egate.alzeer-holding.com/storage/logs/laravel.log`
- Data format: Tab-separated values in ATTLOG table

## Recommendations

### Short-term Solution
1. Access the device's web interface or use ZKTeco software to export the user list
2. Create a mapping table (User ID ‚Üí Employee Name) in your database
3. Parse the logs programmatically to build attendance reports

### Long-term Solution
1. Consider implementing a database to store attendance records
2. Create a proper UI to view/export attendance data
3. Implement the user ID ‚Üí name mapping in your application
4. Set up automated parsing of log files to extract ATTLOG data
